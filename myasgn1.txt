1 Binary Arithmetic

Complete the worksheet on binary arithmetic on the following pages.  Each section must be 100% correct to get each point.

For each of the sections below, you must get the answers completely correct to get the point.



1.1 Unsigned 8-bit arithmetic (1 pt)

For the following unsigned, 8-bit numbers, what is the value (in decimal) of each of the following numbers:

Binary Value : Decimal Value

00000000 : 0

00101100 : 44

11111111 : 255

00010000 : 16 

10000000 : 128 

00010001 : 17 



For unsigned numbers, what is the range of values that can fit in 8 bits? I have done the first one for you to show you what I expect.

Minimum Values

binary: 00000000

decimal: 0



Maximum Values

binary: 11111111 

decimal: 255



1.2 Signed 2's Compliment 8-bit arithmetic (1 pt)

For signed, 8-bit numbers, what is the value (in decimal) of each of the following 2's complement binary numbers:

Binary Value : Decimal Value

00000000  : +0

00011100  : +28

11111111  : -1

00010101  : +21

10000000  : -128

10111001  : -71



For 2's complement signed numbers, what is the range of values that can fit in 8 bits?

Minimum Values

binary: 10000000

decimal: -128



Maximum Values

binary: 01111111

decimal: +127





1.3 Carry and Sign Overflow (1 pt)

Give an example of a Carry overflow without a Sign overflow:

(the decimal result must clearly show a math error)

     Binary:     ___________  +   ___________  =  ____________

     Decimal:    ___________  +   ___________  =  ____________

1.4 Hexadecimal (1 pt)

Translate the following values into hexadecimal:

00000000  : 0

00001011  : B

11111111  : FF

00010101  : 15

10001000  : 88

11010110  : D6



Add the following 16-bit hexadecimal values:

Provide the answer in hexadecimal:

   x24A3 + x5678 = x7B1B

   xABCD + x1EEE = xCABB



Subtract the following 16-bit hexadecimal values:

Provide the answer in hexadecimal:

	x94AA - x5678 = x3E32

	xFBCD - xEEEE = x0CDF



1.5 Bitwise Logic Operations (1 pt)

Perform the following bitwise logical operations.

Provide the answer in hexadecimal:

  	x24A3 & x5087 = x0083

	xABCD | x1EEE = xBFEF



Determine both the operation (ADD/AND/OR/NOT) and the value needed to set bit 5 of the following value to zero (clear bit 5) in a single operation.  Leave the rest of the bits unchanged. (Hint: expand the values to binary.)

Provide the answer in hexadecimal:

       x947A  ADD    x0020   =  x949A 



Determine both the operation (ADD/AND/OR/NOT) and the value needed to set bit 4 of the following value to one (set bit 4) in a single operation.  Leave the rest of the bits unchanged. 

Provide the answer in hexadecimal:

       x76CA  OR    x0010   =  x76DA
